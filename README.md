# Ryanjh

This repository holds all the source code for my personal website, hosted at https://ryanjh.com.

> [!WARNING]
> The website is currently under active development, so the above URL will NOT take you to a functioning website.

## Tech Stack

At this time the project is built using [Symfony](https://symfony.com).

I picked [Symfony](https://symfony.com) because of two big reasons:

1. Their [Backwards Compatibility Promise](https://symfony.com/doc/current/contributing/code/bc.html).
2. Their [LTS support](https://symfony.com/releases).

## Contributing

I'm not actively looking for contributions, considering it's my own personal website.
However, if you see an issue with the source code, feel free to open an issue to discuss it.
