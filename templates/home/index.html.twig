        <p>I'm a Senior Software Developer with over {{ years_of_experience }} years of experience.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>While I’m usually building web services and applications in PHP and Go, I also build networking tools and CLI

            on occasion, tackle frontend development.</p>
        <p>When I’m not working, I’m most likely doing one of the following:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Tinkering with my homelab.</li>
            <li>Mentoring early-career software engineers/computer science students.</li>
            <li>Playing video games.</li>
