        <h1>Hello, I'm Ryan Hendrickson 👋</h1>

        <p>I'm a Senior Software Developer with over {{ years_of_experience }} years of experience.</p>

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I build web services and applications primarily using PHP, Go, and Rust, leveraging these languages for

        <ol>
            <li>Tinkering with my homelab.</li>
            <li>Mentoring early-career software engineers/computer science students.</li>
